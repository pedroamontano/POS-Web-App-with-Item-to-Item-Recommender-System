## The Problem Space

### Building our own POS system, utilising open source code

Moving away from proprietary software and building our own in house system,
utilising open source, to support the business needs for a roaming till system.
By bringing tech in house weâ€™re able to ensure that what we build aligns with our Digital Ethics. For example:
- Running hardware on servers that have a green energy promise.
- Limiting our hardware debt through reuse and recycling, wherever
possible.
- Contributing back to open source and making our own libraries available
for others to use.
- Crafting the optimal user experience for our customers and staff
This opens up endless possibilities in the future as more developers in this space are wanting to embrace ethical tech.

### The Challenge

How might we craft an open-source innovative shopping experience that adapts to the needs of an ever-evolving market, while leading by example with our digital ethics?
