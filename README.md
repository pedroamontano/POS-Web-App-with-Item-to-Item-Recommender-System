## The Problem Space

### Building our own POS system, utilising open source code

Moving away from proprietary software and building our own in house system,
utilising open source, to support the business needs for a roaming till system.
By bringing tech in house weâ€™re able to ensure that what we build aligns with our Digital Ethics. For example:
- Running hardware on servers that have a green energy promise.
- Limiting our hardware debt through reuse and recycling, wherever
possible.
- Contributing back to open source and making our own libraries available
for others to use.
- Crafting the optimal user experience for our customers and staff
This opens up endless possibilities in the future as more developers in this space are wanting to embrace ethical tech.

## The Challenge

How might we craft an open-source innovative shopping experience that adapts to the needs of an ever-evolving market, while leading by example with our digital ethics?

## The Solution
A web application point of sale system for the store's staff. The application has a recommender system feature based on the ingredients of the products being purchased by the customer. The staff provides valuable product story telling for the Lush brand, these recommendations serve as a tool for the staff and could provide horizontal sales growth. The recommender system does not use any consumer data, which is key to the privacy policy for Lush.
